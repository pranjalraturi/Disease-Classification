10. oldpeak ->                     

            Definition:
                      Oldpeak is a measurement that reflects the amount of ST segment depression observed on an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
                      during or after exercise compared to the resting state. It is typically measured in millimeters (mm).

            What is the ST Segment?
                       The ST segment is a vital part of the ECG waveform that provides important information 
                       about the heart's electrical activity, particularly during the recovery phase of the cardiac cycle. 
                       Abnormalities in the ST segment can indicate serious conditions such as ischemia or myocardial infarction, 
                       making it a crucial parameter in cardiac diagnostics and monitoring.

            Normal vs. Abnormal ST Segment
                        Normal ST Segment:
                                 In a healthy heart, the ST segment is typically flat and isoelectric 
                                 (meaning it is at the baseline level of the ECG).
                        Abnormal ST Segment:
                                   ST Segment Elevation:
                                              An elevation of the ST segment above the baseline can indicate 
                                              acute myocardial infarction or other forms of cardiac stress.
                                   ST Segment Depression: 
                                               A depression of the ST segment below the baseline can suggest myocardial ischemia, 
                                               particularly during exercise or stress testing.
                                   Horizontal or Downsloping Depression:  
                                               This is often associated with more significant ischemia and is a key 
                                               finding during stress tests.   

11. Slope -> The Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment

               Description: This parameter describes the slope of the ST segment during peak exercise, typically coded as:
                            0: Upsloping
                            1: Flat
                            2: Downsloping

                            Upsloping: The ST segment rises above the baseline after exercise.
                            Flat: The ST segment remains level with the baseline.
                            Downsloping: The ST segment dips below the baseline.

               Significance: The slope can provide information about the heart's response to stress and potential ischemia.

12. ca -> Number of Major Vessels (0-3) Colored by Fluoroscopy

                 Description: This parameter indicates the number of major coronary vessels (0 to 3) 
                               that show abnormality when viewed using fluoroscopy.
                 Significance: The number of affected vessels can indicate the severity of coronary artery disease.

13. thal -> results of a thallium stress test

                Description: This parameter indicates the results of a thallium stress test, coded as:
                             0: Normal
                             1: Fixed defect
                             2: Reversible defect
                Significance: These results help assess the presence and severity of coronary artery disease.
